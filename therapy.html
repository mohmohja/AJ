            <h2>Osteopathy</h2>
            <p>Osteopathy is a recognised system of diagnosis and manual treatment for dysfunction or injuries to the Musculoskeletal System (joints, muscles, ligaments and connective tissue) and how these relate to the body as a whole.</p>

            <h3>Applicability</h3>
            <p>Osteopathy can help with somatic pains such as neck problems and back problems, sciatica, headaches, traumatic injuries, fibromyalgia, zona, depression.</p>
            <p>With respiratory illnesses such as asthma, allergies, bronchitis, pleurisy.</p>
            <p>With pediatric problems such as colics, spitting up, sucking difficulties, delayed development, birth trauma, cerebral palsy, learning disorders, attention deficit disorders, chronic ear infections, recurrent sore throats, frequent colds, sinusitis, vertigo.</p>
            <p>With systemic problems such as gastrointestinal disturbances, digestive disorders, neurologic disorders, genitourinary problems, chronic infectious diseases, whiplash, head trauma, seizures, post concussion syndrome.</p>
            <p>As well as pregnancy problems such as back pain, groin pain, digestive upset and edema.</p>
            <p>Cancer is another condition where osteopathy can make life more comfortable for those suffering of it.</p>

            <h3>Treatment</h3>
            <p>On your first visit, a full medical case history will be taken. The osteopath will use their highly developed sense of touch called palpation to assess areas of weakness, tenderness, restriction or strain within your body.</p>
            <p>The osteopath will make a diagnosis and discuss it with you and if osteopathic treatment is suitable it will be offered to you. Treatment will be aimed at helping to restore normal joint stability and function.</p>
            <p>Osteopaths usually start any treatment by releasing and relaxing muscles and stretching stiff joints, using gentle massage techniques, rhythmic joint movements and muscle release techniques. The osteopath may also carry out manipulation using short, quick movements to spinal joints. Other techniques may also be used depending on your problem.</p>
            <p>Hinweis: Ein Physiotherapeut darf die Osteopathie nur im Delegationsverfahren, d.h. auf Verordnung eines Arztes oder Heilpraktikers anwenden.</p>
